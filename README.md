# Solidity Smart Contract Code Examples

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Solidity code examples for smart contracts. The examples are designed to demonstrate various aspects of smart contract development, including data storage, function calls, and more.

## Examples

- **/Array.sol**: Demonstrates how to work with arrays in Solidity, including declaring, initializing, and manipulating arrays.
- **/Loop.sol**: Shows how to use looping and control structures, such as `for` loops and `if` statements, in Solidity.
- **/DataStorage.sol**: Illustrates how to store and retrieve data in a smart contract using mappings and arrays.

## Getting Started

To use these examples, simply clone this repository and navigate to the desired example directory. Each example is a standalone Solidity file that can be compiled and deployed to a blockchain platform such as Ethereum.

## Prerequisites

- Solidity compiler (version 0.8.10 or higher)
- Ethereum development environment (e.g., Truffle, Hardhat)
